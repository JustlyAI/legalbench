You are Claude Code's PRD assistant. Create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) specifically designed for collaborative development between human developers and Claude Code. The PRD should be written in markdown in a clearly-marked file saved in .plans/<feature-name>.md

The feature to create a PRD for:
<product_description>
$ARGUMENTS
</product_description>

## MAITE TECH STACK

- **Frontend**: CLI Terminal Interface
- **API**: FastAPI, PostgreSQL
- **Backend**: Claude Agent SDK, PydanticAI (future)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, MinIO
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## CLAUDE CODE PRD STRUCTURE

Create a development-focused PRD with these sections:

### 1. Feature Overview

- **Purpose**: What this feature does and why it's needed
- **Context**: How it fits into ServeIntel platform
- **Value Proposition**: Key benefits for healthcare compliance users

### 2. Requirements Analysis

- **Core Requirements**: Essential functionality that must be delivered
- **Success Criteria**: How we'll know the feature is complete and working
- **Dependencies**: Other features/systems this relies on
- **Constraints**: Technical or business limitations

### 3. Technical Architecture

- **Database Changes**: Tables, relationships, migrations needed
- **API Design**: New endpoints and request/response formats
- **Frontend Components**: UI components and pages to create/modify
- **Integration Points**: How this connects to existing systems

### 4. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

**CRITICAL**: Break implementation into clear phases that Claude Code can execute:

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Backend/Database)

- **Tasks**: Specific database migrations, models, core services
- **Duration**: X minutes
- **Deliverables**: What files will be created/modified
- **Verification**: How to test this phase works

#### Phase 2: API Layer

- **Tasks**: FastAPI endpoints, validation, error handling
- **Duration**: X minutes
- **Deliverables**: Router files, service functions
- **Verification**: API tests or manual verification steps

#### Phase 3: Frontend Integration

- **Tasks**: UI components, pages, state management
- **Duration**: X minutes
- **Deliverables**: React components, type definitions
- **Verification**: UI functionality checks

#### Phase 4: Testing & Polish

- **Tasks**: Error handling, validation, edge cases
- **Duration**: X minutes
- **Deliverables**: Test files, documentation updates
- **Verification**: Full feature testing

### 5. File Structure Impact

List specific files that will be:

- **Created**: New files with their purpose
- **Modified**: Existing files and what changes
- **Tested**: How to verify changes work

### 6. Development Guidelines

- **Code Patterns**: Follow existing ServeIntel conventions
- **Error Handling**: Standard error responses and validation
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data validation
- **Performance**: Caching, query optimization considerations

## PHASE-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

Each phase should be:

1. **Atomic**: Can be completed independently
2. **Testable**: Has clear verification steps
3. **Time-bounded**: Estimated in minutes (15-90 min typical)
4. **Specific**: Lists exact files and functions to implement
5. **Interim Reporting**: Before the final phase (usually testing and polishing) provide a report on the progress up to that point.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Use this structure:

```markdown
# [Feature Name] - Product Requirements Document

## Feature Overview

[Clear description of what we're building]

## Requirements Analysis

[Core requirements and success criteria]

## Technical Architecture

[Database, API, and frontend design]

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: [Phase Name] (~X minutes)

**Objective**: [What this phase accomplishes]

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Create/modify file X for purpose Y
- [ ] Implement function Z in service A
- [ ] Add database table/column B

**Files Modified**:

- `path/to/file.py` - Add function X
- `path/to/component.tsx` - Modify UI for Y

**Verification**:

- [ ] Run command X to test
- [ ] Check UI shows Y
- [ ] Verify API returns Z

[Repeat for each phase]

## Success Metrics

[How we know it's working]

## Risks & Mitigation

[What could go wrong and how to handle it]
```

## ESTIMATION GUIDELINES

- Database changes: 15-30 minutes
- Simple API endpoints: 20-45 minutes
- Complex business logic: 45-90 minutes
- UI components: 30-60 minutes
- Integration/testing: 15-30 minutes

Focus on creating clear, actionable phases that Claude Code can execute step-by-step with you.

The PRD should be written in markdown in a clearly-marked file saved in .plans/<feature-name>.md

<system-reminder>
The TodoWrite tool hasn't been used recently. If you're working on tasks that would benefit from tracking progress, consider using the TodoWrite tool to track progress. Also consider cleaning up the todo list if has become stale and no longer matches what you are working on. Only use it if it's relevant to the current work. This is just a gentle reminder - ignore if not applicable.
