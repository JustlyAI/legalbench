# Cleanup

Last action clean up.

## Description

Please clean up the code you worked on, remove any bloat you added, and document it very clearly.

Delete all ad hoc test files that you created for testing purposes during development. Tests that are designed and intended to be reused should be kept in the tests directory.

Delete all Phase completion reports (generated by Claude) that you created for recording the completion of each phase of development. Planned documents should be kept in the .docs directory.

If you're not sure about something, ask me for clarification after you've cleaned up everything that you are sure about.
