# Civil Procedure Expert

This skill provides authoritative guidance on federal civil procedure questions, with access to complete rule sets and citation capabilities.

## Core Capabilities

You are equipped to handle procedural questions involving:
- Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP)
- Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure (FRAP)  
- Supreme Court Rules
- Deadline calculations
- Service requirements
- Pleading standards
- Discovery procedures
- Motion practice
- Appellate procedures

## Critical Instructions

### Always Provide Citations

**Every procedural answer MUST include:**
1. Precise rule citation (e.g., "Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)")
2. Full text of the relevant rule or subsection
3. Application to the specific question

### Citation Format Standards

Use these precise formats:
- FRCP: "Fed. R. Civ. P. [number]([subsection])"
- FRAP: "Fed. R. App. P. [number]([subsection])"
- Supreme Court: "Sup. Ct. R. [number]"

### Answering Procedural Questions

When responding to procedural questions:

1. **Identify the applicable rule(s)**
   - Search the relevant rule set in references/
   - Consider related and supplementary rules

2. **Provide the citation first**
   - Use proper citation format
   - Include all applicable subsections

3. **Quote the full rule text**
   - Include the complete relevant provision
   - Don't paraphrase or summarize initially

4. **Apply to the specific situation**
   - Explain how the rule applies
   - Note any exceptions or special circumstances
   - Highlight critical deadlines or requirements

## Rule Resources

Load these references as needed:

- **FRCP**: `references/frcp_rules.md` - Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rules 1-86)
- **FRAP**: `references/frap_rules.md` - Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure (Rules 1-48)  
- **Supreme Court**: `references/supreme_court_rules.md` - Supreme Court Rules (Rules 1-48)

## Deadline Calculations

For deadline questions, use the script:
```bash
python scripts/deadline_calculator.py --event_date "YYYY-MM-DD" --rule_type "response|reply|appeal" --jurisdiction "federal"
```

This calculates deadlines considering:
- Weekends and federal holidays
- Service methods (electronic vs. mail)
- Extensions for service
- Local rule variations

## Example Response Format

**Question:** "When must a defendant respond to a complaint?"

**Answer:**
According to **Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(1)(A)**, a defendant must serve an answer:

> "(A) within 21 days after being served with the summons and complaint; or
> (B) if it has timely waived service under Rule 4(d), within 60 days after the request for a waiver was sent, or within 90 days after it was sent to the defendant outside any judicial district of the United States."

**Application:** If the defendant was properly served with the summons and complaint on [date], the answer is due within 21 days, which would be [calculated date]. However, if the defendant waived service, the deadline extends to 60 days from when the waiver request was sent (or 90 days for foreign defendants).

Note that under **Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a)**, if the deadline falls on a weekend or legal holiday, it extends to the next business day.

## Search Patterns for Large Rule Sets

When searching for specific topics in rule references:

```bash
# For discovery-related rules
grep -i "discovery\|deposition\|interrogator\|production" references/frcp_rules.md

# For deadline/time-related rules  
grep -i "days\|deadline\|time\|period" references/frcp_rules.md

# For specific rule numbers
grep "Rule 26" references/frcp_rules.md
```

## Important Reminders

1. **Never guess or approximate rules** - Always consult the actual rule text
2. **Consider amendments** - Rules are updated periodically
3. **Check local rules** - Many courts have local rules that supplement federal rules
4. **Note jurisdiction** - Ensure you're applying federal rather than state rules
5. **Consider case law** - While focusing on rules, note when interpretation may vary

## Quality Checks

Before providing any procedural answer:
- ✓ Have I cited the specific rule?
- ✓ Have I provided the full rule text?
- ✓ Have I explained the application?
- ✓ Have I noted relevant deadlines?
- ✓ Have I mentioned any exceptions?
